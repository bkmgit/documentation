# v1.3.0: Release notes

The v1.3.0 release includes some exciting new functionality and architectural improvements.

Upgrading from v1.2.0 to v1.3.0 requires the upgrade [Migration Notes](v1.2.-to-v1.3.-migration-notes/) to be followed precisely.

The core release is to be used in conjunction with a forked country configuration release v1.3.0

### Major Features

OpenCRVS 1.3 represents a major release of new functional features and technical improvements. The following explains in more detail each major feature that has been included in this release.

#### Marriage registration - beta&#x20;

In this release we have introduced new vital event forms for marriage.  The default form captures bride and grooms details, place of event details, API search for marriage events, informant information for up to 2 witnesses, signature capture for all participants, and a bespoke marriage certificate.

Outstanding marriage related functionality to be built includes:  searching for marriage events in the UI, marriage performance analytics, configurable marriage fees, marriage corrections and a notification of intent to marry form.

Due to the outstanding functionality yet to be developed, we are releasing marriage registration in "beta", therefore not for production use. You can configure marriage registration on in development environments for proof of concept testing.

#### Track issuance&#x20;

A new workqueue and business process has been introduced to track that certificates have actually been issued to individuals.  In this way we realise the benefit of proving that paper certificates get into the hands of beneficiaries, and where we understand areas where collection rates may be low.

#### Verify a certificate via QR code

You can now add a QR code to every certificate and this QR code can be used by any individual with rights to the system to be able to verify that a certificate is genuine.  The QR code contains a unique identifier, the "**recordId**", which via the Record Search API can also be programatically validated by trusted external systems, returning vital event records associated.

#### Informant signature&#x20;

It is possible to configure informant signature capture on and off for birth and death events.  By default marriage events require the participant and witness signatures.

#### Email notifications&#x20;

In previous versions of OpenCRVS it was only possible to use SMS or WhatsApp as a notification delivery method to staff and beneficiaries.  Now it is possible to use Email.

#### Business intelligence dashboards&#x20;

Configurable analytics dashboards with rich information visualization has been introduced, powered by the OpenSource Business Intelligence engine [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/).

#### De-duplication update&#x20;

The entire de-duplication user experience process has been upgraded, focusing on an optimised user experience to be able to quickly review potential duplicate records side by side along with supporting documentation.  The de-duplication algorithm is powered by [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) and thanks to the power of that system that highlights duplicates in real-time, registrars can easily approve, override or reject the record instantly.

#### Configurable user roles, notification & login backgrounds (...and many more)

Many new application settings are now configurable, such as user role titles can be entirely customised even though they are based on common existing permissions.  Individual informant notifications can be configured on or off and the login application can be branded to suit your country.

#### MOSIP Integration v2 - E-Signet&#x20;

Our close collaboration with MOSIP continues in this release with integration in the form directly into the E-Signet digital identity authentication and consent mechanism.  Using MOSIP E-Signet integration, parents and informants can have their IDs validated, and consent to share demographic information to pre-populate the registration form.  By combining OpenCRVS and MOSIP
