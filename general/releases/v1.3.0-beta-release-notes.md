# v1.3.0: Release notes

The v1.3.0 release includes some exciting new functionality and architectural improvements.

They are critical for a wide range of government operations, e.g. population register, national identification system, and other administrative registers, and for commercial enterprises (e.g. life insurance and marketing of products).
