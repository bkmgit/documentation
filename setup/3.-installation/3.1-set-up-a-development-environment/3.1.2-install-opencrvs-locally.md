# 3.1.2 Install OpenCRVS locally

{% embed url="https://www.loom.com/share/6e649d5d32464523ac40b5d9c4c750d5" %}
Install OpenCRVS locally using our default Farajaland country configuration
{% endembed %}

The following instructions will guide you on how to set up a local, demo development environment of OpenCRVS using our fictional country configuration: "Farajaland".

1. Check you have installed all the dependencies in the previous section
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core.git`
3. Run `cd opencrvs-core`
4. Run `git checkout master`
5. Run `bash setup.sh` (takes 10-15 minutes)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Do not use **`sudo bash setup.sh`**!&#x20;

Many Ubuntu developers get into a bad habit of using **sudo** before every command. &#x20;

The `bash setup.sh` command needs to set folder permissions for Elasticsearch and Docker.  If you use sudo, the owner of the /data folder becomes root.  You will encounter permissions problems that are hard to debug.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

This installer script will:

* Test that your dependencies are installed correctly
* Checks that required ports are available. **Note:** MacOS Monterey runs AirPlay on port 5000. Mac Monterey users need to disable AirPlay in System Preferences in order to run OpenCRVS.
* Download and install all Docker images
* Check out the example OpenCRVS country configuration
* Runs all OpenCRVS Core microservices
* Run the OpenCRVS fictional country configuration, "Farajaland" and populate local databases with Farajaland reference data

6\. If there are any missing dependencies the script will exit and display instructions. Once the dependency is satisfied, you can try again.

7\. On completion you will see the Classic OpenCRVS logo like this&#x20;

* Proceed to login using the details in the [section 3.14 Log in to OpenCRVS](3.1.4-log-in-to-opencrvs-locally.md).
* To stop OpenCRVS running in the installer, type **ctrl+c**, then **exit** in each tmux terminal window
