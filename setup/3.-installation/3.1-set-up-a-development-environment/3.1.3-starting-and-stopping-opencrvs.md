Starting and stopping OpenCRVS
{% endembed %}

After you have installed OpenCRVS, the setup script will have installed the [opencrvs-farajaland country configuration](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland) in a directory alongside opencrvs-core. The country configuration is a separate server that must be started and stopped alongside opencrvs-core.

To start and stop opencrvs-core and the country configuration server, use the following commands.

#### Starting OpenCRVS Core

1. Ensure you have navigated inside the opencrvs-core directory: `cd opencrvs-core`
2. Run `yarn dev` to start opencrvs-core.  You will be asked to confirm that you are ready to start a country configuration server alongside opencrvs-core.   If you ran our bash setup.sh script, then you already have opencrvs-farajaland directory available alongside opencrvs-core.  Click Y to continue, or N to exit.
3. Wait for the OpenCRVS client app to build completely (output will stop and you will see the message: _@opencrvs/client: Compiled with warnings._ Along with TypeScript/Node dependency warnings... ), then OpenCRVS Core will be available.  _See NOTE below ..._

#### Starting OpenCRVS Country Configuration

1. Open a new terminal window
2. Run `cd ../opencrvs-farajaland` or cd into your forked country configuration.
3. Run `yarn dev` to start the country configuration server.  Note: The video above shows the user passing the path to the core directory as a parameter to "yarn dev".  As of v1.1.0 this is no longer required.

{% hint style="info" %}
NOTE: If you did not previously run our `bash setup.sh` command, Docker will have to download Mongo DB, ElasticSearch, OpenHIM and Hearth docker images. These are large files. Then docker will build them and you will see Mongo errors output for a long time until Mongo is running.\
\
If you did run our setup command, OpenCRVS will start much faster and these errors will not last very long before the @opencrvs/client: Compiled with warnings. message appears.
{% endhint %}

#### Stopping

1.  Press Ctrl+c in the opencrvs-core terminal.  After a few seconds Docker will prompt you to type Ctrl+c again to stop any running containers.  \

    {% endhint %}


2. Press Ctrl+c in the opencrvs-farajaland terminal, or your forked country configuration termina

### Other servers

When OpenCRVS is running, you can browse to other interesting server dependencies of OpenCRVS such as:

#### React Storybook

Our UI component style guide, will be available here: [**http://localhost:6060/**](http://localhost:6060/)

This is a work in progress to assist front end developers and designers in developing new UI features.

#### OpenHIM

OpenHIM is designed to ease interoperability between OpenCRVS and external systems such as Health & National ID. It provides external access to the system via secure APIs. OpenHIM channels and governs internal transactions, routing, orchestrating and translating requests into [FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) between services and the database layer.

1. Visit [`http://localhost:8888/#!/login`](http://localhost:8888/#!/login)
2. Login. username: **root@openhim.org** / Password: **wXV8xSW2Ju5X3EPn**\
   \
   When logging into OpenHIM locally, OpenHIM will display an SSL error " ..if you are using a self-signed certificate, you may first need to instruct your browser to accept it.\
   \
   You can do so by accessing the following link." Click the link, and you will see the Chrome: Your connection is not private" error.  \
   \
   This is nothing to worry about as when deploying OpenCRVS core to a server, our Traefik service provisions a LetsEncrypt SSL cert across the entire stack. \
   \
   Click "Advanced" & "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)". You will see output like this `{"master":655.1310464,"now":1642447245037}`.\
   \
   You can now go back to this OpenHIM link and login again freely: [**http://localhost:8888/#!/login**](http://localhost:8888/#!/login)
