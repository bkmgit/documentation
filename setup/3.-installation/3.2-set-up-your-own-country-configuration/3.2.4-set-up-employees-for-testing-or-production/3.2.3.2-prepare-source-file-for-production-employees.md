# 3.2.3.2 Prepare source file for production employees

Prepare your _**prod-employees**_ source file.  This is a [csv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated\_values) file for every production employee that will have initial access to your live production environment.  It is our recommendation that you only create a single National System Administrator, and a single Local System Administrator user for every office that they will be required to create users for. &#x20;

In production, it is these users who should login to the production server and use the Team section and the User Management functions to create users using the live application.&#x20;

You can import and create csv files in Excel or Google Drive. &#x20;

All of these users will be able to sign in to OpenCRVS with the **an automatically generated, strong password** which we be created and displayed to you **just once** when running the **Import set up files** commands in section [**3.2.5**](../3.2.5-import-set-up-files.md).   All of these users will be required to use a **unique mobile phone number that receives SMS 2FA codes** when logging in.

These users will be created in a "**pending**" state and required to change their password and set up reset authentication credentials security questions when logging in for the first time.

Using our Farajaland [prod-employees.csv](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/blob/master/src/features/employees/source/prod-employees.csv) file as an example, you can create your live system administrators.  Our prod-employees.csv file looks like this:

| facilityId               | environment | username   | givenNames | familyName | gender | role                    | type | mobile     | email         | signature |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------ | ----------------------- | ---- | ---------- | ------------- | --------- |
| CRVS\_OFFICE\_2OKicPQMNI | production  | j.campbell | Jonathan   | Campbell   | male   | NATIONAL\_SYSTEM\_ADMIN |      | 0921111111 | test@test.org |           |

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not change or re-format the header row as the code requires these names to be precise in order to parse the csv.  Do not use commas in any cell and do not have any empty rows.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Notice that our example contains only one National System Administrator.**  You do not necessarily need any more than this one user, as the application can be used to make more system administrators (LOCAL or NATIONAL).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Notice that the format is identical to the csv format for test-employees**.  The only difference is the **environment** column must be set to "**production**" for live, production users.  &#x20;
{% endhint %}
