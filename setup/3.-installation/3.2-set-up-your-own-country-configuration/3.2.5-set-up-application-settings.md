# 3.2.5 Set up application settings

The next step is to configure some functional application settings.  Some of these settings can be changed later using the OpenCRVS [Functional Configuration](../../4.-functional-configuration/) UI by a National System Administrator. Others must be configured now during installation and cannot be changed in production.

You will be referring to the Config: Application Settings Excel sheet that would have been prepared in [section 2: Gather requirements](../../2.-gather-requirements.md).

Prepare your _**application-config-default.ts**_ source file. This is a Typescript file that is loaded in the application via an API explained in [section 3.2.9 Countryconfig APIs explained](3.2.9-countryconfig-apis-explained/).

Using our [application-config-default.ts](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/src/api/application/application-config-default.ts) file as an example, update the settings according to your needs.  You can skip the certificates as we will come back to this in section [3.2.6 Configure certificate templates](3.2.6-configure-certificate-templates.md).
