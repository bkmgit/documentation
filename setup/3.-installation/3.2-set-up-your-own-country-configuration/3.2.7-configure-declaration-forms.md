# 3.2.7 Configure declaration forms

### Before you start

* Only a National System Admin can configure application settings
* Default configuration for birth and death forms are based on UN guidelines
* A set list of questions are required for registration and can not be removed
* You can add any number of custom questions to a page
* Update labels, error messages, placeholders, select options etc following our guidance in section [3.2.7-set-up-language-content.md](3.2.9-countryconfig-apis-explained/3.2.7-set-up-language-content.md "mention")
* Note the 3 statuses of a declaration form under configuration, Draft, In Preview and Published.\
  **Draft**: can be edited\
  **In Preview**: available for Field agents, Registration Agents and Registrars so you can test the form\
  **Published**: the declaration form configuration is complete and your OpenCRVS configuration is ready to go live.
* **Once a declaration form has been set to the status 'Published' it can no longer be edited. NOTE: You will have to start again, clear your database and repeat the processes from** [3.2.5-import-set-up-files](3.2.5-import-set-up-files/ "mention") **to make any changes to a published form.**
* You may notice the warning "Nothing is currently published..." Any test declaration, or event registration made while forms remain unpublished are deleted from the database at the point of publishing. **Do not use OpenCRVS in production with unpublished forms.**
