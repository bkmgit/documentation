# 3.2.7.1 Configuring an event form

Take a brief look at the [directory structure](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/tree/develop/src/form/birth) for a form configuration for an event:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-09-07 at 16.42.23.png>)

The [index.ts](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/src/form/birth/index.ts) file shows you how a form is configured.



### Sections

A registration form is made up of **pages** or "**Sections**". &#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is required that a birth form must have a "child", "mother", "father", "informant", "registration" & "documents" section.
{% endhint %}

We have abstracted away 2 complex sections: "registration" & "documents", into dedicated functions in the [required-sections.ts](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/src/form/birth/required-sections.ts) file.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You should not edit the registration section function.  It is a required hidden section to store vital identifiers for the draft.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Feel free to edit the [documents](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/551e864ab59d59ae2e65eec8d1d0d9651ae0a3d7/src/form/birth/required-sections.ts#L38) section function to configure the supporting documentation you wish to be uploaded by users for each registration.
{% endhint %}



### Groups

A "Section" can be split over multiple **sub-pages**, users can gradually click through using "**Groups**".  1 Group must exist in each section. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In our example form, there is only 1 group per section.
{% endhint %}



### Fields

Groups contain a **fields** array and each field is rendered by an abstracted **form field function**. &#x20;

These are the functions that actually render the fields. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can move form field functions up and down to change the vertical order of fields.
{% endhint %}

#### Required fields

Required field functions are imported from the [required-fields.ts ](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/src/form/birth/required-fields.ts)file.   Some required fields are replicated for any event in order to reduce repeated code. These common required fields are imported from the [common-required-fields.ts](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/src/form/common/common-required-fields.ts) file situated up a directory in the common folder.

Required fields are marked by a comment after each function closure like this:

```
// Required
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Required functions must be included **AS IS** for OpenCRVS civil registration functionality to operate.  They **CANNOT** **BE CUSTOMISED.**  They are U.N. standard fields.  If you are receiving direction to customise them from civil registration authorities, please get in touch with us at [team@opencrvs.org](mailto:team@opencrvs.org)  We can liaise with your authorities to explain why they are configured the way they are, usually for [standardisation](../../../../technology/standards/) and [interoperability](../../../../technology/interoperability/) requirements.  **Customising these fields inhibits your government's ability to interoperate between departments.**
{% endhint %}

#### Optional fields

Optional fields are imported from the [optional-fields.ts](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/src/form/birth/optional-fields.ts) file.  They can be commented out or removed if you dont want them.

Some optional fields are replicated for any event in order to reduce repeated code. These common optional fields are imported from the [common-optional-fields.ts](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/src/form/common/common-optional-fields.ts) file.

Each optional form field function looks a bit like this:

```
export const attendantAtBirth: SerializedFormField = {
  name: 'attendantAtBirth',
  type: 'SELECT_WITH_OPTIONS',
  label: formMessageDescriptors.attendantAtBirth,
  required: false,
  initialValue: '',
  validator: [],
  placeholder: formMessageDescriptors.formSelectPlaceholder,
  options: attendantAtBirthOptions,
  mapping: getFieldMapping(
    'attendantAtBirth',
    certificateHandlebars.attendantAtBirth
  )
}
```



{% hint style="danger" %}
You **CANNOT** edit the **name**, **type** or **mapping** properties of a custom field.
{% endhint %}

The properties handle how the field renders with multi-lingual [content](../3.2.9-countryconfig-apis-explained/3.2.9.1-managing-language-content.md) for example with "label" and "placeholder".

You can configure recognisable HTML input properties such as "required" & "options"



There are OpenCRVS specific props such as "mapping" regarding how these fields map to and from GraphQL/FHIR.  The mapping function points to the certificate handlebar prop you use when adding the user inputted value onto a [certificate](../3.2.6-configure-certificate-templates.md).
