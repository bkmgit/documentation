# 3.2.7.1 Configuring an event form

Take a brief look at the [directory structure](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/tree/develop/src/form/birth) for a form configuration for an event:

The [index.ts](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/src/form/birth/index.ts) file shows you how a form is configured.

A registration form is made up of **pages** or "**Sections**". &#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is required that a birth form must have a "child", "mother", "father", "informant", "registration" & "documents" section.
{% endhint %}

We have abstracted away 2 complex sections: "registration" & "documents", into dedicated functions in the [required-sections.ts](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/src/form/birth/required-sections.ts) file.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You should not edit the registration section function.  It is a required hidden section to store vital identifiers for the draft.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Feel free to edit the [documents](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/551e864ab59d59ae2e65eec8d1d0d9651ae0a3d7/src/form/birth/required-sections.ts#L38) section function to configure the supporting documentation you wish to be uploaded by users for each registration.
{% endhint %}

A "Section" can be split over multiple **sub-pages**, users can gradually click through using "**Groups**".  1 Group must exist in each section. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In our example form, there is only 1 group per section.
{% endhint %}

Groups contain a **fields** array and each field is rendered by an abstracted **form field function**.

Each form field function looks a bit like this:

```
export const informantType: SerializedFormField = {
  name: 'informantType',
  type: 'SELECT_WITH_OPTIONS',
  label: formMessageDescriptors.informantsRelationWithChild,
  required: true,
  hideInPreview: false,
  initialValue: '',
  validator: [],
  placeholder: formMessageDescriptors.formSelectPlaceholder,
  mapping: getFieldMapping(
    'informantType',
    certificateHandlebars.informantType
  ),
  options: birthInformantTypeOptions
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can move form field functions up and down to change the vertical order of fields.
{% endhint %}

In each group, required fields are loaded from the required-fields.ts file.  These functions must be included for OpenCRVS to function.  These required fields are marked by a comment after each function closure like this:

```
// Required
```



Optional fields can be commented out or removed if not required
