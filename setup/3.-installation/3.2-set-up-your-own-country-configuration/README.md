# 3.2 Set-up your own country configuration

This section instructs you how to set-up and provision factory reset reference data for your OpenCRVS country configuration, and replace the default repository (Farajaland) with your country's repository.

The instructions should be conducted sequentially as laid out in each step, and will include:

1. Forking our fictional country configuration "Farajaland" into your own country configuration repository.
2. Understanding of the API endpoints available in the country configuration and their business use-cases.
3. Configuration of your registration forms and certificates.
4. Preparation of the following source files that can be used to seed your database for initial use of OpenCRVS:

a) Your country's administrative address structure to be used as standardised and interoperable geolocation for registrations, employees, civil registration offices and health facilities.

b) A geolocated list of all the civil registration offices where registrations occur and where staff are located.

c) A geolocated list of all the health facilities where births and deaths occur.&#x20;

d) An initial list of test or production, civil registration employee users who can access the system. (Users can be created using the OpenCRVS user interface at any time)

e) Global application settings

f) All multi-lingual text content
