# 4. Functional configuration



### Before you start

* You must have first completed all the required steps in [Installation](../3.-installation/), particularly:&#x20;

[3.2-set-up-your-own-country-configuration](../3.-installation/3.2-set-up-your-own-country-configuration/ "mention")

[3.3-set-up-a-server-hosted-environment](../3.-installation/3.3-set-up-a-server-hosted-environment/ "mention")

* Only a National System Admin can configure these settings
* They are provisioned independently for every environment you are hosting: Staging, QA & Production.  You may want to make a new factory reset backup when you are finished to make it easier to deploy to new environments. [3.2.6-create-factory-reset-reference-data-backups.md](../3.-installation/3.2-set-up-your-own-country-configuration/3.2.6-create-factory-reset-reference-data-backups.md "mention")

This section introduces the configuration steps that your National System Admin will be required to do: &#x20;

1. Configure the application settings (registration time periods and fees)
2. Configure declaration forms
3. Configure certificate templates
4. Create system users
